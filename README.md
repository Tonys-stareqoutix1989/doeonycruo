Okay, here goes. Just tumbled outta the theater for Control Freak and I'm telling you, my head is spinning faster than that silly carnival ride. Eck, there's still popcorn stuck to my jeans, and I swear the seat was designed by a sadist with a grudge against spinal columns. But wow. The  ? It was a trip through a chaotic carnival of twisted control and lost sanity.

I think the main guy was named Jake? Or Jack? I dunno, but he was more tightly wound than a vintage clock. His eyes had that edge of desperation like my cat’s demanding for tuna at 3 am. At some point, I think he was in this room full of clocks – or was it mirrors? It’s all jumbled like my grandma’s attic. Anyway, sound was everywhere, kinda like I accidentally wandered into an avant-garde soundscape art installation. Really wish I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to make sense of who was chasing who.

> Got a whiff of popcorn syrup halfway through, from somewhere behind me, and it really shot me right back into the   like a teleporting ninja. His mother loomed large over everything, kind of like one of those looming giant marshmallows in a hot chocolate afterthought, just swooping in at the wrong moment—lord, it was almost too much.

There was this one scene where everything seemed to collapse inward, kinda like when you put too many clothes in a small suitcase, and you can't understand why they don't fit, despite your superior packing skills. The colors were ramped up to eleven, like being slapped with a rainbow-flavored cold fish—sounds bizarre, I know, but that’s exactly what came to mind. Honestly, if you want to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , have a backup plan for decompressing afterward, maybe yoga for the soul or a real nice nap.

Sarah or maybe it was Laura – or neither – ended up in this garden, but everything was wrong. You know how ants just go everywhere, crawly paths teasing a direction, but never getting there? Exactly like that. It was garden full of 'not quite rights', like pineapples growing on cacti. Felt really surreal.

Remember when the lights came back on, and I wasn’t sure if the murmur of the audience felt like their brains were rebooting kind of vibes. I’m still seeing flashes of scenes, like someone spilled paint in my brain and gave it a real good stir. If someone could just bottle that chaotic brilliance into a drink... call it Fuzzy Chaos or something.

if sanity == “concept”:
    def hold_on():
        return further_unraveled
    
hold_on() or maybe don’t, might be catching on to something.
